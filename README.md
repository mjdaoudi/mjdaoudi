### Hi, I am Mehdi 👋

---

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my internship at FARI - AI for common good, trying to build multilingual embeddings in an unsupervised set up.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow/ pytorch for deep learning sake and NextJS for web development !
- 💬 Ask me about spearfishing in the atlantic seas, I'll be happy to support you ⚓️.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I played guitar for 3 months, without tuning it. Once I discover how to tune it, I realize Bob Marley has nice vibes...

### Current projects 👨🏽‍💻

#### 1. Multilangual embeddings

The idea is to build word representations that can benefit from other languages. The aim is to enhance classification models running in Brussels' Public Labor Agency. In fact, in Brussels, three languages are spoken : French, Dutch and English.

#### 2. Transportation Analytics SaaS

It all started with a public transportation company which proposed a case to solve regarding its network analytics. I nailed the project by proposing several interesting solutions that I think can be levered in further companies and applications.
